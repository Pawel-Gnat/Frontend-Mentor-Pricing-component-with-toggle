## My process

Java Script:

2. Made 3 functions that toggle my price,
3. Made event listener on input to change my price on click.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Done in 5 hours. I practiced my JS skills a little. I wonder how to set my price switch in one specific position while I reload my page. Should I use local storage?
